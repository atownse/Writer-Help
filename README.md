## Project Overview

For this project we were tasked with creating an application that used React, Router and properly tsted the components that were created. I spent some time practicing with hooks as I aim to get better at understanding them and incorporating them. This application allows a user/struggling writer to choose whether they want to view the random characters that have been created or attempt to create one for themselves with certain options they would like to know about the character which will then be displayed for them as they are taken to the path that shows them. They are then given the option to choose to make more characters provided they are not impressed with the current details.

## Goals
For this project I wanted to practice with hooks as well as the logic when dealing with checkboxes.

## Technologies
Javascript
React
Router
Jest
CSS


## To Do
In the future I would like to expand upon the choices a user can make as well as make the saved ones permanent, possibly with firebase since I have practied with it.
